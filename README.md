# Boids
 
 [Boids](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/) or '2 dimensional bird-like-objects' is a visual program to 
 simulate the flocking patters on birds. It incorperates predators for the flocks to avoid.
 
 In this Windows Desktop App the Boids will follow the following rules
    - If a boid is normal it tries to flock with other normal birds and avoids zombies
    - If a boid is a zombie it tries to attack normal boids
    
## Building and running
